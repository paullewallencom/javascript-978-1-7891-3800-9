* outline - Identical to the 'simple' example in terms of Javascript, but using a Scenario Outline to generate Scenarios
* datatable - Adaptation of the 'simple' example to use a Data Table to add an arbitrary list of numbers
* hooks - Demonstration of a Before hook for resetting data
* events - Demonstration of event handling for the lifecycle of running tests
* world - Demonstration of the World concept for data sharing
